###Project Description

####Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0

The "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0" was the results of experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

####Notes on the final tidy data set.

This project uses the above dataset to create an independent Tidy Dataset (file  "Step5TidyData.txt") using the run_analysis.R script.  Below is a sample view:

Dimensions of the dataset :  180 objects , 68 variables

####Summary of the data

     Column Description
        1   "subject"
			Type:  integer
			Range:   1 - 30
			This refers to the 30 volunteers.

        2:  "activity"
			Type:  chr
			Range: "laying" "sitting" "standing" "walking" "walking_downstairs" "walking_upstairs"

####Column 3-68 are data collected (or derived) from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the phone.  

            Column 3-42 are ALL numeric
            Starting with "t..." , these are all time domain signals.
            Please refer to features_info.txt for more information with respect to these parameters.
