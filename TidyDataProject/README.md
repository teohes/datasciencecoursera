###  Files and Directory Setup

Download and extract the ""UCI HAR Dataset"" data files into the current directory.
Below are the initial folders and files that should be in the current directory

		- 	test  --(directory containing the test data)
		- 	train --(directory containing the training data)
		- 	activity_labels.txt --(list the six activities and correcsponding code for each)
		- 	features.txt --(lists the 561 features/variables collected/calculated)
		- 	features_info.txt --(description of the feature selection)
		- 	README.txt (Original file describing the above dataset)

##  run_analysis.R

The file *run_analysis.R* is also located in the above directory. The final step of this script will produce the datafile  "Step5TidyData.txt" (in the current directory).


##  Description of run\_analysis.R


### Note: The libraries used in this script are: **library(dplyr)** and **library(reshape2)**.
1.  The data files were all read in using the following form:


		dataset <-read.table("filename.txt",header=FALSE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
2.  Inspection of the X\_train.txt (in the train directory above) and X\_test.txt (in the test directory above) using both Notepad++ and also loading the files into R using read.tables show that they can be safely concatenated row-wise using rbind.
3.  The same applies for the y\_train, subject\_train and y\_test and subject\_test data.  They are similarly concatenated
4.  The concatenation of the data is always done by adding the test data to the bottom of the training set data for consistency.
5.  Merging the training dataset and test dataset (see STEP 1. in the run\_analysis.R )
6.  



##  Add the column names



## We can similarly concatenate the training set data y_train with
## the test set data y_train.  (y_train and y_test are the activity labels)

y_train<-read.table("train/y_train.txt",header=FALSE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
y_test<-read.table("test/y_test.txt",header=FALSE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
y_combine<- rbind(y_train,y_test)
##  Label the column "activity"
colnames(y_combine)[colnames(y_combine) == "V1"] <- "activity"

## Similarly concatenate the training set ""subject_train"" with
## the test set data "subject_test"".
subject_train<-read.table("train/subject_train.txt",header=FALSE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
subject_test<-read.table("test/subject_test.txt",header=FALSE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
subject_combine<- rbind(subject_train,subject_test)
##  Label the column "subject"
colnames(subject_combine)[colnames(subject_combine) == "V1"] <- "subject"

## We can now column combine the above 3 entities into 1 dataset
xcombine<- cbind(subject_combine, y_combine, X_combine)
##
## Clean up the workspace
rm(X_train,X_test)
rm(y_train,y_test)
rm(subject_train,subject_test)
rm(X_combine,subject_combine,y_combine)
##
##  STEP 2
## To extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
## First we add 2 variables to the beginning (left side) of the features.txt data
##  This is to account for the 2 extra columns we added to the xcombine data above

features<- rbind( c("NA","activity"),features)
features<- rbind( c("NA","subject"),features)

## Now find all the columns we wish to keep  (ie. to extract the mean and std)
colToKeep<-grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)|activity|subject", tolower(features$V2))

## Copy all the columns we want to keep to new dataset
xfinal<-xcombine[,colToKeep]

## Clean up the workspace
rm(xcombine, colToKeep, features)

##
## Reading in The Elements of Data Analytic Style by Jeff Leek
## he highly recommended that labels/variables should be in lowercase
## and that all "." , "-" and special characters be removed.  
## I am following his recommendation and have converted all labels/variables

## STEP 3  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## Next, insert the actual activity name (in lowercase) into the xfinal dataset using
##			1 walking
##			2 walking_upstairs
##			3 walking_downstairs
##			4 sitting
##			5 standing
##			6 laying
xfinal$activity<-gsub("1","walking",xfinal$activity)
xfinal$activity<-gsub("2","walking_upstairs",xfinal$activity)
xfinal$activity<-gsub("3","walking_downstairs",xfinal$activity)
xfinal$activity<-gsub("4","sitting",xfinal$activity)
xfinal$activity<-gsub("5","standing",xfinal$activity)
xfinal$activity<-gsub("6","laying",xfinal$activity)
##
## STEP 4  Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
## We have already labelled the "subject" and "activity" variable earlier
## Here as described above, remove all special characters eg. "-", ")", "(" 
## and lowercase them
simplifynames<-gsub("-","",names(xfinal))
simplifynames<-tolower(gsub("\\(\\)","",simplifynames))
names(xfinal)<-simplifynames
##
## Clean up the workspace
rm(simplifynames)

## 
## STEP 5   From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy
## data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
##
##
xfinal<-group_by(xfinal,subject,activity)
xfinal<-summarise_each(xfinal,funs(mean))
##
##
## Save the tidy data set
write.table(xfinal,file="Step5TidyData.txt",row.names=FALSE)

##  To read the saved file and examine in it in R, use the following commands:
##
##       data <- read.table("Step5TidyData.txt", header = TRUE) 
##       View(data)
